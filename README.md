# ATOMIQ

The open source unified CaaS/FaaS platform for Docker, batteries included.

 * Host your own high availability cluster or use `cloud.atomiq.io`
 * [Docker Infrakit](https://github.com/docker/infrakit) for self-healing infrastructure
 * Use Docker Compose v3 [stackfiles](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) to deploy your stacks ([CaaS](https://blog.docker.com/2016/02/containers-as-a-service-caas/))
 * Support lambda style [serverless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing) tasks ([FaaS](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html))
 * Account management support for users, organizations and teams with role-based access controls
 * Logs and metrics realtime filtered feeds and historical query support
 * [Kibana dashboard](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/dashboard.html) service included

The current version is `0.9`. While not recommended for production use quite yet, it's getting close
(about six weeks away). In the meantime, you can use the current playground hosted at `cloud.atomiq.io`,
and you can also host your own cluster. You can even create a full cluster on your own laptop
with `amp cluster create` using the CLI.
