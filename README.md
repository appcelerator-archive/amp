# AMP - the open source CaaS / FaaS platform for Docker

AMP is an open-source Container-as-a-Service ([CaaS](https://blog.docker.com/2016/02/containers-as-a-service-caas/))
platform for managing and monitoring containerized applications,  microservices, and microservice workers as part
of a unified [serverless computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing) environment.
It is based on the swarm mode features introduced with Docker 1.12, providing developers with
a straightforward development strategy for building on these features without the need to stray from the
core Docker ecosystem and adopt complex third party frameworks.


This current version of this project is only a few months old and under heavy development. It is not
ready for production.
