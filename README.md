# AMP - the open source CaaS platform for Docker

AMP is an open-source Container-as-a-Service ([CaaS](https://blog.docker.com/2016/02/containers-as-a-service-caas/))
platform for managing and monitoring containerized applications,  microservices, and microservice workers as part
of a unified [serverless computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing) environment.
It is based on the swarm mode features introduced with Docker 1.12, providing developers with
a straightforward development strategy for building on these features without the need to stray from the
core Docker ecosystem and adopt complex third party frameworks.

There is a 5 minute introductory video under [docs](docs/).

This current version of this project is only a few months old and under heavy development. It is not
ready for production.
