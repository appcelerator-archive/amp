# Appcelerator Microservice Platform (AMP)

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/appcelerator/amp](https://badges.gitter.im/appcelerator/amp.svg)](https://gitter.im/appcelerator/amp?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

AMP's goal is to provide a platform and simple tools to help developers manage and monitor complex, orchestrated service applications. AMP is based entirely on the swarm mode features introduced with Docker 1.12, providing developers a simple path to exploit these features in a hosted environment (that runs locally during development) without straying from the core Docker ecosystem and the need to adopt complex third party frameworks.

# Prerequisites

All of the infrastructure services and almost all tooling is completely
containerized: 

Docker the main prerequisite that is required.

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker)
* `make` (almost all the Makefile rules execute in containers now)

Currently, to run tests and a few tools like `gofmt`, Go still needs to be installed on the system.

* [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Directories

* `api/rpc` - contains the directories for specifying our rpc services and messages. They should be segregated by service and only contain *.proto files for definitions and *.pb.go files that are generated by the rpc rule in the Makefile (`make rpc`). Running `make install` or `make build` will automatically invoke the rpc rule.
* `api/server` - contains the implementation files for the api/rpc/* service interfaces, and also contains `server.go`, which registers each service with a server on port 50501.
* `api/cmd` - contains directories corresponding to the two generated executable binaries: `amp` (the CLI) and `amplifier` (the server daemon).
* `data` - backend datastores for configuration, state, stats, and logs.
* `vendor` - along with `glide.yaml` and `glide.yaml`, used for dependency management.

## Makefile

* `make` - (no arguments) will print version/build info, run a check on your code, then install `amp` and `amplifier` in `$GOPATH/bin`.
* `make check` - runs a series of formatting and lint checks on the source. Make sure to run before submitting a PR.
* `make fmt` - will format the source according to go conventions.
* `make clean` - cleans up auto-generated code and deletes the `amp` and `amplifier` executables from `$GOPATH/src`.
* `make rpc` - run this if you want to update generated files without doing a full build.
* `make install` - will (re)build the project and install the executable binaries (`amp` and `amplifier`) in `$GOPATH/src`.
* `make build` - will build a docker image (`appcelerator/amp:latest`) that contains the binaries.
* `make run` - will run `amplifier` in a container.
* `make test` - will run automated tests.
* `make proto` - will regenerate all protocol buffer files using `protoc`.
* `make install-deps` - will reinstall all required packages under the `vendor` directory.
* `make update-deps` - will update all package dependencies.

## Package Management

The project uses [Glide](https://glide.sh/) for vendoring, which is an approach to locking down packages that you have tested for a specific
version. Glide isn't the only tool that supports vendoring, but it is one of the more popular ones. The Go community generally commits all the
vendor artifacts (the `vendor` directory and lock file (`glide.lock`), along with the dependency specification (`glide.yaml`) file).

When you want to add new dependencies to the project, run `glide get <package>`.

When you want to reinstall dependencies, run `make install-deps`.

When you want to update to the latest versions, run `make update-deps`. Run `make test` to ensure tests continue to pass after updates
before submitting a PR.

## Swarm

Use the `swarm` shell script to launch amp cluster services. Available commands are:

 * pull
 * start
 * ls
 * restart
 * stop
 * monitor

The usual workflow looks like this:

    $ ./swarm pull
    $ sudo ./swarm start --min
    $ ./swarm monitor
    $ sudo ./swarm restart --min (equivalent to stop, pull, start)
    $ sudo ./swarm stop

## CLI

AMP currently uses GitHub authentication for logging in. The CLI command `amp login` will use your GitHub credentials to authenticate
you via GitHub. You need to be a member of the AMP team in the Appcelerator organization to be authorized. For the GitHub OAuth flow
to work, you need to start `amplifier` with a client ID and secret before you can run the `amp login` command. Follow these instructions
for now:

* [Create](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) an OAuth application (to simulate the amp backend)
* Note the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
* Start `amplifier` with the following flags:
    $ amplifier --clientid <Client ID> --clientsecret <Client Secret> &
* Use the CLI to login
    $ amp login
* When prompted, enter username, password, and two-factor auth code

### Logs

The `amp logs` command is used to query or stream logs. It provides useful filtering options to manage what is presented.

    $ amp logs --help

    Search through all the logs of the system and fetch entries matching provided criteria.
    
    Usage:
      amp logs [flags]
    
    Flags:
          --container string      Filter by the given container id
      -f, --follow                Follow log output
          --from string           Fetch from the given index (default "-1")
          --message string        Filter the message content by the given pattern
      -m, --meta                  Display entry metadata
          --node string           Filter by the given node id
      -n, --number string         Number of results (default "100")
          --service-id string     Filter by the given service id
          --service-name string   Filter by the given service name
    
    Global Flags:
          --Config string   Config file (default is $HOME/.amp.yaml)
          --server string   Server address (default "localhost:50101")
          --target string   target environment ("local"|"virtualbox"|"aws") (default "local")
      -v, --verbose         verbose output


A few useful examples:

* To fetch and follow all the logs from the platform:
```
  $ amp logs -f
```

* To fetch and follow the logs for a specific service, with the message content only:
```
  $ amp logs -f --service_name etcd
```

### Stats

The `amp stats` command provides useful information about resource consumption. There is a comprensive set of options
to query and monitor specfic metrics that complements and extends what is visible in the web dashboard (http://localhost:6001).

    $ amp stats --help

    Get statistics on containers, services, nodes about cpu, memory, io, net.

    Usage:
      amp stats [flags]

    Flags:
          --container               display stats on containers
          --container-id string     filter on container id
          --container-name string   filter on container name
          --cpu                     display cpu stats
          --datacenter string       filter on datacenter
      -f, --follow                  Follow stat output
          --host string             filter on host
          --image string            filter on container image name

          --mem                     display memory stats
          --net                     display net rx/tx stats
          --node                    display stats on nodes
          --node-id string          filter on node id
          --period string           historic period of metrics extraction, duration + time-group as 1m, 10m, 4h, see time-group
          --service                 displat stats on services
          --service-id string       filter on service id
          --service-name string     filter on service name

          --task-id string          filter on task id
          --task-name string        filter on task name
          --time-group string       historic extraction group can be: s:seconds, m:minutes, h:hours, d:days, w:weeks
          --until string            date defining when stop the historic metrics extraction, format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm

    Global Flags:
          --Config string   Config file (default is $HOME/.amp.yaml)
          --target string   target environment ("local"|"virtualbox"|"aws") (default "local")
      -v, --verbose         verbose output

A few useful examples:

* To display list of services with cpu, mem, io, net metrics and follow them
