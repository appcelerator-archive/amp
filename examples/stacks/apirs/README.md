APIRS
=====

## Overview

The deployment consists in 3 stages:

* Stage 1 starts: 
  * mongodb
  * consul
  * redis
  * registry

* Stage 2 initializes:
  * the replica set in mongodb
  * KV store in consul

* Stage 3 starts:
  * acs
  * dashboard
  * admin
  * stratus
  * app-stats-monitor
  * push-dispatcher
  * registry-auth

The mongodb configuration and the consul configuration have to be created as Docker config beforehand.

## Prerequisite

Login to Portus with your Portus credentials using docker login:

    $ docker login services-registry.cloudapp-enterprise-preprod.appctest.com:5000

Build the `kvcodec` tool in order to prepare your consul KV configuration and run in this directory:

    $ go build -o kvcodec .
    
Make sure your amp CLI is at least version 0.17.0.

If you plan to deploy on AWS, prepare your AWS credentials. The recommended way is to use the [~/.aws/credentials file](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.html) but you can also pass the access key id and the secret access key as parameter to the CLI, as described in `amp cluster create -h`.

## Local Deployment

For local deployments you won't have S3 buckets or NFS servers, unless you set it by your own means.

### Cluster creation & sign up
    amp cluster create
    amp -k user signup

No need to verify the login, because it's a local deployment, you're logged in by default (relaxed security for dev environments).

### Configuration
The `consul.json` file is configured for local deployments. You only need to generate your Consul KV configuration file using the following command:

    ./kvcodec encode consul.json > kv.json

Then you need to create the following Docker `config`s:

    amp -k config create mongo_dbinit mongo_dbinit.sh
    amp -k config create consul_kv kv.json

### Deploying the stacks

Run in this directory:

    amp -k stack deploy --with-registry-auth -c apirs.stage1.yml
    # Check point: amp -k service ps apirs_mongo-primary

    amp -k stack deploy --with-registry-auth -c apirs.stage2.yml
    # Check point: amp -k service ps apirs_mongo-init

    amp -k stack deploy --with-registry-auth -c apirs.stage3.yml

## Cloud Deployment

Full instructions on cluster deployment on AWS is available on the [amp wiki](https://github.com/appcelerator/amp/wiki/AMP-Clusters-deployment-on-AWS), the following section is a quick guide adapted to the APIRS use case.

### Cluster creation & sign up

    export STACK_NAME=amp-$USER
    export STACK_NAME=YOUR_KEYPAIR
    
#### Create cluster

    amp cluster create --provider aws --aws-region us-west-2 --aws-stackname $STACK_NAME --aws-parameter KeyName=$KEYPAIR_NAME --aws-parameter NFSEndpoint=true

the output will show the URL of the cluster. We'll refer to is as $REMOTE_SERVER.
it will also show the NFS endpoint. We'll refer to is as $NFS_ENDPOINT.

    export REMOTE_SERVER="URL of the cluster"
    export NFS_ENDPOINT="URL of the NFS server"
    
PS: if you don't want to store your credentials in the ~/.aws/ folder, you can alternatively use CLI arguments to pass the credentials:

      --aws-access-key-id YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID --aws-secret-access-key YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

#### Enable user registration

this is a cloud cluster creation, the user registration will go through email notifications and will require a user verification.
to use this feature, the cluster requires a SendGrid key, without it the user registration will fail
First, obtain a Sendgrid key. You can get a 30 days trial here: https://app.sendgrid.com/signup?id=71713987-9f01-4dea-b3d4-8d0bcd9d53ed

ssh to a manager node
update the amplifier configuration with the following lines:

    cat > amplifier.yml << EOF
    EmailKey: _SENDGRID_KEY_
    SUPassword: _SUPER_USER_PASSWORD_
    JWTSecretKey: _JWT_RANDOM_STRING_
    EOF
    cat amplifier.yml | docker secret create amplifier_yml_custom -
    docker service update --secret-rm amplifier_yml --secret-add source=amplifier_yml_custom,target=/run/secrets/amplifier.yml amp_amplifier

Register your user:

    amp -k -s $REMOTE_SERVER user signup
    # followed by user verification and login (as detailed in the email notification)


#### Adding object storage

You can now add object storage for APIRS. In the following command we'll use BUCKET1 and BUCKET2, you should use your own unique names.

Create the new buckets:

    amp -k -s $REMOTE_SERVER object-store create BUCKET1
    amp -k -s $REMOTE_SERVER object-store create BUCKET2

List the existing buckets available in the cluster, make sure you see BUCKET1 and BUCKET2:

    amp -k -s $REMOTE_SERVER object-store list

### Configuration

The `consul.json` file is configured for local deployments. You need to replace the all the domain names occurrences 
in `consul.json` from `apirs.local.appcelerator.io` to the domain you're going to use. For instance:

    sed s/apirs.local.appcelerator.io/apirs.aws.appcelerator.io/g consul.json > cloud.json

You then need to generate a Consul KV configuration file by running he following command.

    ./kvcodec encode cloud.json > kv.json
    
Then you need to create the following Docker `config`s:

    amp -k -s $REMOTE_SERVER config create mongo_dbinit mongo_dbinit.sh
    amp -k -s $REMOTE_SERVER config create consul_kv kv.json

### Deploying the stacks

    amp -k -s $REMOTE_SERVER config stack deploy -c apirs.stage1.yml
    # Check point: amp -k -s $REMOTE_SERVER service ps apirs_mongo-primary

    amp -k -s $REMOTE_SERVER config stack deploy -c apirs.stage2.yml
    # Check point: amp -k -s $REMOTE_SERVER service ps apirs_mongo-init
    # Have a look at consul, and update the key value store with your domain name. There's also the global/nfs_server and global/nfs_server_ip that should be updated if you have one.

    amp -k -s $REMOTE_SERVER config stack deploy --with-registry-auth -c apirs.stage3.yml

    curl -k -H Host:acs.apirs.local.appcelerator.io https://$REMOTE_SERVER/v1/admins/ping.json

This last line simulates a DNS alias by using a HTTP header, but if you set a real DNS record as a CNAME resolving to $REMOTE_SERVER, it can be used directly in curl or a browser.

## AMP Dashboard

For local deployment, connect to http://dashboard.local.appcelerator.io/

For cloud deployment, check the output of the cluster creation for the link to the dashboards.

An extra dashboard sample with panels specific to Apirs can be imported in Grafana: `apirs.dashboard.json`.
