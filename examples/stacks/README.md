# Example Stacks

The `examples/` directory contains example applications running from stackfiles for demo and quick start purposes.

To run them:
  - start docker
  - run `amp pf pull`
  - run `amp pf start`
  - run `amp pf monitor` not mandatory, but useful to follow the amp start up in another console
  - follow the instructions in the README.md in the example directory
