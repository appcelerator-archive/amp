# gotools

This is a collection of Go tools that can be used from in a container for convenience
and from makefiles so they don't need to be installed as prerequisites.

These tools are used by the amp toolchain.

Currently includes

* [Go 1.8](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/)
* [Glide](https://glide.sh/) v0.12.3
* [Golint](https://github.com/golang/lint)
