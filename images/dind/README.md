# dind

[On Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/appcelerator/dind/).
Convenience image based on latest Docker in Docker with experimental flag set and
a few network utilities (like iproute2, dig and drill).

Why is this useful? Right now if you want to start dind with the experimental flag
you have to explicitly supply it as follows:

    $ docker run --detach --privileged --name=dind docker:dind --experimental
    $ docker exec -it dind sh
    / # docker version
    Client:
     Version:      1.13.0
     API version:  1.25
     Go version:   go1.7.3
     Git commit:   49bf474
     Built:        Wed Jan 18 16:20:26 2017
     OS/Arch:      linux/amd64

    Server:
     Version:      1.13.0
     API version:  1.25 (minimum version 1.12)
     Go version:   go1.7.3
     Git commit:   49bf474
     Built:        Wed Jan 18 16:20:26 2017
     OS/Arch:      linux/amd64
     Experimental: true

You can see from the last line that the daemon was started in experimental mode.
With this image, however, experimental mode is the default:

    $ docker run --detach --privileged --name=dind appcelerator/dind

This image also adds a few convenient network tools, [iproute2](http://baturin.org/docs/iproute2/)
[dig](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dig), and [drill](https://linux.die.net/man/1/drill) (from the [ldns project](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/ldns/)).
