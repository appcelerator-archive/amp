# AWS Plugin

This is the plugin for creating and initializing an AWS cluster.

`Dockerfile.compiler` builds the image for compiling the Go source files for
the plugin.

`Dockerfile` builds the image for the actual plugin that will be used by the
AMP cli.

For more details about the design and use, see the
[wiki](https://github.com/appcelerator/amp/wiki/AWS-Clusters).
