# AMP Completion Command

The `amp completion` command allows you to add shell completion to your AMP CLI.

## Usage

```
$ amp completion --help

Usage:	amp completion SHELL [flags]

Output shell completion code for the specified shell (bash or zsh)

Examples:

		# Install bash completion on a Mac using homebrew

		    $ brew install bash-completion

		Once installed, bash_completion must be evaluated.  This can be done by adding the
		following line to the .bash_profile, and reloading it

		    source $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion

		    $ source $HOME/.bash_profile

		# Write bash completion code to a file

		    $ amp completion bash > ~/.config/amp/completion.bash.inc

		Add this line in your $HOME/.bash_profile, and reload it

		    source "$HOME/.config/amp/completion.bash.inc"

		    $ source $HOME/.bash_profile

		# Load the amp completion code for zsh[1] into the current shell
		source <(amp completion zsh)

Options:
  -h, --help            Print usage
  -k, --insecure        Control whether amp verifies the server's certificate chain and host name
  -s, --server string   Specify server (host:port)
```

> TIP: Use `-h` or `--help` option for any of the AMP commands or sub-commands to more information about the command's usage.

## Installation

In order to use shell completion with AMP, follow the installation instructions for your corresponding shell.

### Bash

Make sure bash completion is installed:
* Most current Linux OS (non-minimal installations) have bash completion.
* On Mac, install with `brew install bash-completion`

After bash completion is installed, add the following line to your `~/.bash_profile` file:
```
source $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion
```
Then, either source your `~/.bash_profile` or launch a new terminal.

Now you need to write the bash completion, generated by AMP, to a file. We recommend writing
it to a file in your `$HOME/.config/amp` directory.
```
$ amp completion bash > ~/.config/amp/completion.bash.inc
```

After doing this, add the following line to your `~/.bash_profile` file to source your bash completion file.
```
source "$HOME/.config/amp/completion.bash.inc"
```

Then either source your `~/.bash_profile` or launch a new terminal again.

### Zsh

In a Zsh shell, load the amp completion code with:
```
$ source <(amp completion zsh)
```
or add `source <(amp completion zsh)` to your `~/.zshrc` file.

## Examples

With the shell completion code loaded for AMP, you can hit tab twice to view the shell completion.
```
$ amp
cluster     completion  config      login       logout      logs        password    service     stack       stats       team        user        version     whoami
```

```
$ amp stack
deploy    logs      ls        rm        services
```

```
$ amp stack deploy -c examples/stacks/pinger/
README.md   pinger.yml
```
