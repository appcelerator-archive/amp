# Permission levels for an organization

After you create an organization, you should give **Owner** permissions to a small group of people who will manage the organization account.

Organization members can have **owner**, or **member** roles:

 * **Owners** have complete administrative access to your organization. This role should be limited to a few people in your organization.

 * **Members** are the default role for everyone else.
