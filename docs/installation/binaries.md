# Installation from binaries

**This instruction set is meant for hackers who want to try out AMP
on a variety of environments.**

Before following these directions, you should really check if a packaged
version of AMP is already available for your distribution. We have
packages for many distributions, and more keep showing up all the time!

## Check runtime dependencies


## Check kernel dependencies


> **Warning**:
> Installing custom kernels and kernel packages is probably not
> supported by your Linux distribution's vendor. Please make sure to
> ask your vendor about Docker support first before attempting to
> install custom kernels on your distribution.

> **Warning**:
> Installing a newer kernel might not be enough for some distributions
> which provide packages which are too old or incompatible with
> newer kernels.

Note that AMP also has a client mode, which can run on virtually any
Linux kernel (it even builds on OS X!).
